# Logistic Regression for Rain Prediction in Australia Weather Dataset
## Problem Statement
The Rain in Australia dataset comprises approximately 10 years of daily weather observations collected from various Australian weather stations. The dataset provides valuable insights into weather patterns, and as a data scientist at the Bureau of Meteorology, your objective is to develop a fully-automated system. This system should utilize today's weather data for a specific location to predict whether it will rain at that location tomorrow.
